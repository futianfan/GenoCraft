# Single-cell RNA-seq Preprocessing with STAR

This README guides you through the preprocessing steps for single-cell RNA-seq analysis using the STAR alignment tool. The workflow includes installing STAR, preparing the reference genome, aligning reads, and post-alignment processing with feature counting and analysis in R.

## 1. Installation

Begin by installing STAR. You can clone the repository and compile the source code as follows:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR.git
cd STAR/source
make STAR
```

## 2. Preparing the Reference Genome

To align your RNA-seq reads, first generate an index of your reference genome. You need a FASTA formatted genome file and a gene annotation file in GTF format:

```bash
STAR --runThreadN NumberOfThreads \
     --runMode genomeGenerate \
     --genomeDir /path/to/genomeDir \
     --genomeFastaFiles /path/to/genome.fasta \
     --sjdbGTFfile /path/to/annotations.gtf \
     --sjdbOverhang ReadLength-1
```

- **NumberOfThreads**: Number of threads for parallel processing.
- **ReadLength**: The length of your RNA-seq reads minus one.

## 3. Aligning the Reads

Once the genome index is ready, you can proceed to align your RNA-seq reads:

```bash
STAR --genomeDir /path/to/genomeDir \
     --readFilesIn /path/to/read1.fastq /path/to/read2.fastq \
     --runThreadN NumberOfThreads \
     --outFileNamePrefix /path/to/outputPrefix \
     --outSAMtype BAM SortedByCoordinate
```

- Ensure the reads' files are correctly specified for single-end or paired-end data as applicable.

## 4. Post-Alignment Processing

After alignment, convert the output into a format suitable for single-cell RNA-seq analysis tools. Typically, this involves converting the STAR outputs to a count matrix:

```bash
featureCounts -T NumberOfThreads \
              -a /path/to/annotations.gtf \
              -o counts.txt \
              -g gene_id \
              /path/to/alignedReads.bam
```

- **gene_id** is used to aggregate counts by gene identifiers from GTF.

## 5. Analyzing in R

After obtaining your counts matrix, load it into R for downstream analysis using tools like Seurat or SingleCellExperiment:

```r
library(Seurat)
counts <- Read10X(data.dir = "/path/to/countMatrixDirectory")
seurat_object <- CreateSeuratObject(counts = counts)
```

- Perform normalization, scaling, and clustering within Seurat as per your analysis needs.
